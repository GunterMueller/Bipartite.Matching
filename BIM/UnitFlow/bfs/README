This directory contains a C implementation of the bipartite graph
generators rbg1 and rbg2.

rbg1 produces a random bipartite graph. Usage is:

rbg1 <N/2> <ene> [<seed>]

where N is total number of vertices (each partition will have N vertices)
      ene is expected vertex degree (can be a floating point number)
      seed is an optional seed for the pseudo random generator

rbg2 produces a random bipartite graph that has a group
structure. Usage is:

rbg2 <N> <G> <ene> [<seed>]

where  N is number of vertices per group
       G is number of groups
         => total number of vertices is N*G*2 (each partition will have N*G vertices)
       ene is expected vertex degree (can be a floating point number)
       seed is an optional seed for the pseudo random generator
